# My Daily Planner

This repository is for a side project I implemented: A daily planner app which includes a calendar with an event adding feature, as well as multiple todo lists for the week.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Start

In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to start up the project.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## How to Use
### Todo List
- Enter tasks in the input bar under each respective day's todo list.
- Delete tasks by clicking on the task you want to delete.
- Check off a task by clicking the checkbox next to the task.

### Calendar
- Add an important event to the calendar using the form below it. Select an icon, date, and a description (optional) for the event and click "Add". It will now show up on the calendar.
- Hover over an icon to see the event's description.
- Delete an event from the calendar by clicking on the corresponding badge on the calendar.
